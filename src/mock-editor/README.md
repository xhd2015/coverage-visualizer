# Tree Pattern

> I've just struggled for 2 days on the Tree.

Tree is a common data structure in development, but how we think about it is another thing.

# Structure

```
TestingExplorer {
    TestingList{
        ExpandList {
            List
        }
    }
    TestingEditor {
        MockEditor {
            ExpandList {
                List
            }
        }
    }
}
```
